# Hi there 👋

I'm **Fabio Augusto** and mainly a Java Developer!<br>
Currently, my main skill involves architecting and running easily scalable and maintainable systems, while also being proficient in multiple other areas 😄

My main goal is to create systems that are simple but scalable at the same time, allowing easy maintenance and future upgrades.<br>
🔭 I’m currently working as Lead Developer at [Wynncraft](https://wynncraft.com/) and contributing to open-source projects like [Wynntils](https://github.com/Wynntils)!<br>
⚡ Fun fact: I started programming at 12 years old trying to create my own Minecraft server!
